- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tzdwi (a.k.a., Trevor Dorn-Wallenstein). I'm an astrophysicist with broad interests in how massive stars evolve and explode. 
Most of the code I've written is for scientific analysis, using some Bayesian statistics, machine learning, signal processing, and more.
- ðŸ“« If you're interested in collaborating, or want to reach out/learn more, you can find me at [my website](tzdwi.github.io).
